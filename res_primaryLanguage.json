    "description": "Hi there! I'm a Competitive Programmer and a Candidate Master at Codeforces, with a 6 Star rating on Codechef. I'm also a Front-end Developer and a DevOps Engineer, constantly working to hone my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. I hail from IIIT Gwalior, where I gained a solid foundation in computer science and software development. I've always had a passion for problem-solving, which led me to pursue competitive programming and participate in various coding competitions. Despite my technical expertise, I also have a creative side that comes through in my front-end development work. I love using my programming skills to bring beautiful and user-friendly interfaces to life. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends in my hometown of Indore. ",
